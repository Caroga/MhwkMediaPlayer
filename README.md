A web-based media player for your private collection

Development environment
=======================
The development environment is implemented using Vagrant and Ansible. You need
to install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) first to continue.

To get going you need to cd to the project and run __vagrant up__. More on this
is in the [vagrant docs](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/). To view the project
point your browser to the [configured ip](http://192.168.60.10).

On windows, no synced folders are set-up atm, you can use an ftp client (in your
IDE) to do the syncing for you over ssh.
